# CLI-Starter-Kit-Example

This is an example of how one would use the the [CLI-Starter-Kit](https://github.com/brandon-irl/CLI-Starter-Kit) project. It is meant to illustrate how the CLI Starter Kit application can become your own CLI utility running any arbitrary code.

This repository consists of several projects (which you can ignore unless you're interested) and a submodule of the [CLI-Starter-Kit](https://github.com/brandon-irl/CLI-Starter-Kit) project. This submodule is on a branch that contains the changes that do the actual demonstration. You could just checkout that branch, but they rely on these other projects (hence the other repo).

## Getting it running
Just checkout this repo, making sure to include the submodule 
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:brandon-irl/CLI-Starter-Kit-Example.git
```
And run the MyConsoleApp.sln file (see Microsoft's documentation on this filetype).

## Contribution
This repo is not intended for contribution. Changes to the [CLI-Starter-Kit](https://github.com/brandon-irl/CLI-Starter-Kit) project should be made in that repository instead. This repo is for demonstration purposes only.
